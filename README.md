  <strong>Spring 2017 APCS Final Project:</strong><br>
  A chemistry simulation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Collaborators:</strong><br>
  Andrew Chen<br>
  Ida Wang<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How to Use It:</strong><br>
  Run "cool.pde" in processing within the "cool" directory.<br>
  Use the control bar drop-down menu to choose a certain element, and click the "add" button to add 5.<br>
  Click the simulation to clear it of all particles.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Working Features:</strong><br>
  Click to add atoms (of varying elements) directly in the simulation.<br>
  Control bar to select specific atoms to add and adjust temperature.<br>
  Atoms can bounce off walls and each other in 3D!<br>
  Atoms attract and repel each other based on their charge.<br>
  Atoms can ionize each other based off electronegativity.<br>
  Covalent bonds between particles, including double and triple bonds. Some common molecules form.<br>
  Basic electron replusion (vsepr).<br>
  Colors!!!!!!!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Unresolved Bugs:</strong><br>
  Finding the closest particles is difficult.<br>
  Starts slowing after adding ~100 atoms.<br>
  Everything moves quickly, making it hard for solids to form.<br>
  Changing the temperature only speeds up / slows down individual atoms, not molecules.<br>
  Adjusting temperature is also only written to briefly increase/decrease the acceleration of the particles, so any new atoms added start at the regular velocity rather than at the same velocity of the rest of the particles.<br>
