Something about chemistry.<br>
<br>
Collaborators:<br>
Andrew Chen<br>
Ida Wang<br>
<br>
How to Use It:<br>
Run "cool.pde" within the "cool" directory.<br>
List of Working Features:<br>
6/5 - Click to add balls in the simulation.<br>
6/6 - Balls can bounce off the walls in 3D!<br>
6/8 - Balls attract and repel each other based on their charge.<br>
<br>
List of Unresolved Bugs:<br>
6/8 - It explodes when there's too many balls (~30), because of too many calls to pushMatrix().<br>
6/9 - Starts freezing after adding ~100 balls.
