  <strong>Spring 2017 APCS Final Project:</strong><br>
  A particle simulation<br>
  Something about chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Collaborators:</strong><br>
  Andrew Chen<br>
  Ida Wang<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How to Use It:</strong><br>
  Run "cool.pde" in processing within the "cool" directory.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Working Features:</strong><br>
  Click to add balls in the simulation.<br>
  Balls can bounce off the walls in 3D!<br>
  Balls attract and repel each other based on their charge.<br>
  Covalent bonds between particles.<br>
  Basic electron replusion (vsepr).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Unresolved Bugs:</strong><br>
  Starts freezing after adding ~100 balls.<br>
  Finding the closest particles is difficult.<br>
