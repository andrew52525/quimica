Spring 2017 APCS Final Project: Particle Simulation<br>
Something about chemistry.<br>
<br>
Collaborators:<br>
Andrew Chen<br>
Ida Wang<br>
<br>
How to Use It:<br>
Run "cool.pde" in processing within the "cool" directory.<br>
<br>
List of Working Features:<br>
Click to add balls in the simulation.<br>
Balls can bounce off the walls in 3D!<br>
Balls attract and repel each other based on their charge.<br>
Covalent bonds between particles.<br>
Basic electron replusion (vsepr).<br>
<br>
List of Unresolved Bugs:<br>
Starts freezing after adding ~100 balls.<br>
Finding the closest particles is difficult.<br>
