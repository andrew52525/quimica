  <strong>Spring 2017 APCS Final Project:</strong><br>
  A particle simulation.<br>
  Something about chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Collaborators:</strong><br>
  Andrew Chen<br>
  Ida Wang<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How to Use It:</strong><br>
  Run "cool.pde" in processing within the "cool" directory.<br>
  Click to add 10 atoms (of varying elements) in the simulation.<br>
  Use the control bar drop-down menu to specific a certain element, and click the "add" button to add 5.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Working Features:</strong><br>
  Click to add atoms (of varying elements) directly in the simulation.<br>
  Control bar to select specific atoms to add (see List of Unresolved Bugs).<br>
  Balls can bounce off the walls in 3D!<br>
  Balls attract and repel each other based on their charge.<br>
  Particles can interact to form covalent bonds.<br>
  Basic electron replusion (vsepr).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Unresolved Bugs:</strong><br>
  Finding the closest particles is difficult.<br>
  Drop-down menu for some reason is only adding Hydrogen and then some other green molecule.<br>
