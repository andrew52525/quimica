  <strong>Spring 2017 APCS Final Project:</strong><br>
  A chemistry simulation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Collaborators:</strong><br>
  Andrew Chen<br>
  Ida Wang<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How to Use It:</strong><br>
  Run "cool.pde" in processing within the "cool" directory.<br>
  Use the control bar drop-down menu to choose an element, and click the "Add" button to add 5 atoms.<br>
  To speed up / slow down the particles click "Increase" or "Decrease" respectively.<br>
  Click the simulation to clear it of all particles.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Working Features:</strong><ul>
  <li>Click to add atoms (of varying elements) directly in the simulation.</li>
  <li>Control bar to select specific atoms to add and adjust temperature.</li>
  <li>Atoms can bounce off walls and each other in 3D!</li>
  <li>Atoms attract and repel each other based on their charge.</li>
  <li>Atoms can ionize each other based off electronegativity.</li>
  <li>Covalent bonds between particles, including double and triple bonds. Some common molecules form.</li>
  <li>Basic electron replusion (vsepr).</li>
  <li>Colors!!!!!!!</li></ul>
  <br>
  <strong>List of Unresolved Bugs:</strong><ul>
  <li>Finding the closest particles is difficult.</li>
  <li>Starts slowing after adding ~100 atoms.</li>
  <li>Everything moves quickly, making it hard for solids to form.</li>
  <li>Changing the temperature only speeds up / slows down individual atoms, not molecules.</li>
  <li>Adjusting temperature is also only written to briefly increase/decrease the acceleration of the particles, so any new atoms added start at the regular velocity rather than at the same velocity of the rest of the particles.</li></ul>
